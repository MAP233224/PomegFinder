# PomegFinder
Parameter finder for performing the Pomeg Glitch in Pokémon DPPT.  

Here's the most human-optimized way to perform the Pomeg Glitch in these games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipg3J3COXHQ

When performing the Pomeg Glitch in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl (all languages) or Platinum (japanese and english only), you need to lose at least 2 HP from using a single Pomeg Berry when you only have 1 HP remaining.
This application helps you find the requirements necessary for a specific Pokémon, provided a range of levels, the amount of HP EVs you're willing to give it prior to performing the glitch, and its HP base stat.  

NB: "EVs (+10)" signifies that you'll need to give your Pokémon exactly x+10 EVs before performing the Pomeg Glitch, this accounts for the EVs lost when using the berry. 

Range of acceptable values for each parameter:  

- EVS_MIN = 0
- EVS_MAX = 245
- LEVEL_MIN = 1
- LEVEL_MAX = 100
- BASE_STAT_MIN = 10
- BASE_STAT_MAX = 255
